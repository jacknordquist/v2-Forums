# v2 Forums Custom App
Custom v2 forums app made for all iOS platforms! This app allows you to view the forums at community.v2.co in a beautiful app environment. Currently, the app is a single-site WKWebView application with no added features - updates will be released soon. 


## How to Download the App
In order to download the app, you must sideload this app to your iPhone or iPad. To learn how to sideload, [see here.](https://bouk.co/blog/sideload-iphone/) Please note that you will also need to create a free developer account with your current Apple ID as outlined [here.](https://9to5mac.com/2016/03/27/how-to-create-free-apple-developer-account-sideload-apps/)


## Putting the app in mobile view.
There is currently an issue with the v2 website itself which causes the app to open in desktop view. To fix this, follow these easy steps:


#### 1. Open the app and tap the menu button in the top right corner.

#### 3. You should now be in mobile view and all features should work properly. You will not have to repeat these steps unless the app is deleted.

## App Features
The v2 Forums app has all of the same features as the website. You are able to log in and interact with the entire site. In addition, you are able to __go back and forward through previously visited pages by *swiping left and right*__ 

### Updates Coming Soon
- Hopefully a fix for the mobile/desktop bug.
- Automatic updates (refresh function)
- App store app if approved by v2!
- And more!
