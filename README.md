# v2 Forums Custom App
Custom v2 forums app made for all iOS platforms! This app allows you to view the forums at community.v2.co in a beautiful app environment. Currently, the app is a single-site WKWebView application with no added features - updates will be released soon. 

## App Features
The v2 Forums app has all of the same features as the website. You are able to log in and interact with the entire site. In addition, you are able to __go back and forward through previously visited pages by *swiping left and right*__ 

### Updates Coming Soon
- Automatic updates (refresh function)
- Support for notifications
- And more!

### Bug Reporting
If you stumble upon any bugs or would like to learn more, you can message me on the v2 forums @jack. Thanks!
